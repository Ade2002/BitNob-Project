        <p>‚ÄúBitnob_official is my first dance with crypto.
            Not a full-blown tap dance yet... but more
            like a waltz üòÖ. But it‚Äôs such an easy product
            for us non-crypto intellectuals to use. I love
            the simplicity of the product, but I love the
            team behind it even more.‚Äù</p>
